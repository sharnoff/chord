This package provides a collection of tools for building your own internal task management.
The needs of different projects differ, so an opinionated one-stop-solution will necessarily have
limited use. This package aims to provide the building blocks that tend to be common across such
systems.

For an example of this package in use, see: <https://github.com/neondatabase/autoscaling/blob/chord-task-mgmt/pkg/task/manager.go>.
